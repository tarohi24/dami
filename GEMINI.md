# DAMI is a collection of my personal data services

## Coding style

- I prefer dependency injection (DI). Use `container.py` for DI.

## Testing

- Run `uv run pytest` for unittesting.

## BigQuery (BQ)

I use bigquery as the main database.
The tables are created with the schema in `bigquery/schema/`.
